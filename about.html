            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website! This is my first real website that I made. I'm probably going to use it for my personal stuff in the future.</p>

            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>I'm currently studying Cyber Security at <a href="https://www.cichnovabrno.cz/" class="link1">Secondary School of Informatics, Post and Finance Brno</a>.</p>

            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Except for studying, I also enjoy playing games. I especially like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arma_(series)" class="link1">Arma series.</a>
                Recently, I also got into playing <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2" class="link1">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, which I enjoy for It's story.
                <br> I also enjoy reading, watching films/series and playing board games.
